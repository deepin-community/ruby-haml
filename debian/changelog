ruby-haml (3.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Paul van Tilburg ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Source packages adapted according to the new Ruby policy:
    - Build for both ruby1.8 and ruby1.9.1.
    - Migrated to pkg-ruby-extras git repos; changed the Vcs-* fields in
      debian/control accordingly.
    - Changed the depends and recommends to follow the new Ruby library
      naming scheme.
  * debian/control:
    - Added a default DM-Upload-Allowed field set to yes.
    - Standards-Version bumped to 3.9.2; no changes required.
    - Set XS-Ruby-Versions to all.
    - Changed the build-depends for using gem2deb instead of ruby-pkg-tools.
    - Switched the maintainer with the uploaders field as per new
      convention the team is the default maintainer.
    - Added a build-depend-indep on rake, yard (>= 0.5.3), ruby-sass and
      ruby-maruku (>= 0.5.9) for documentation generation.
    - Added a build-deped-indep on rails for the tests.
    - Added a recommend on ruby-sass as it is no longer included in Haml
      upstream (not even from the vendor dir).
    - Added libhaml-ruby, libhaml-ruby1.8, libhaml-ruby-doc and haml-elisb
      as transitional packages.
  * debian/copyright: reworked to fit the DEP5 format.
  * debian/docs: install generated docs
  * debian/haml-elisp.NEWS: install a NEWS file to explain that the
      emacs modes have disappeared.
  * debian/install: install the VERSION files to the libdir of haml so
      that Haml::Util.version works.
  * debian/manpages: install manpages debian/html2haml.1 and debian/haml.1.
  * debian/patches:
     - 001fix-hardcoded-gem-path.patch:  dropped, this is now handled by
       gem2deb.
     - 002get-version-from-right-path.patch: dropped, doesn't work if we
       also want to support Ruby 1.9.
     - 003fix-root-path.patch: added, fixes the root path so that
       Haml::Util.scope works properly.
  * debian/rules:
    - Call `rake doc` to generate documentation using yard.
    - Disable tests for now... it doesn't seem to work at all with our
      Rails 2.0 setup.
    - Remove the installed sass.rb and plugin/sass.rb dummy libraries that
      tries to load Sass via a gem/from the vendor dir.

  [ Gunnar Wolf ]
  * Added myself to uploaders
  * Separate the $LOAD_PATH modification from the require call in
